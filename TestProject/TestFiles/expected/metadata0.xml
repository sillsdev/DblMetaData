The Tboli are one of the indigenous peoples of South Cotabato in Southern Mindanao. The population is 95,300. There are 10,000 monolinguals. The total Ethnic population is 100,000 to 120,000. They live in the region of South Cotabato Province, Southwestern Mindanao. From the body of ethnographic and linguistic literature on Mindanao they are variously known as Tboli, T'boli, Tböli, Tiboli, Tibole, Tagabili, Tagabeli, and Tagabulu. They term themselves Tboli or T'boli. The language classification is Austronesian, Malayo-Polynesian, Philippine, Bilic, Tboli. They reside on the mountain slopes on either side of the upper Alah Valley and the coastal area of Maitum, Maasim and Kiamba. In former times, the Tbolis also inhabited the upper Alah Valley floor. Since the arrival of settlers originating from other parts of the Philippines, they have been gradually pushed onto the mountain slopes. As of now, they are almost expelled from the fertile valley floor. Language use is by all ages. They speak their language to each other more freely in buses, surrounding towns, etc. Language development includes literacy programs in heretofore unreached coastal mountain ranges. They operate their own government schools. They have there own poetry, dictionary and grammar. A Bible was produced 2007. The writing system is in the Latin script.<br />
